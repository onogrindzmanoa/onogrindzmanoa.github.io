# About OnoGrindzManoa 

OnoGrindzManoa is a Meteor application currently in development with the goal of providing dining information for the University of Hawaii community. Finding food on campus is a significant challenge, especially when there are so many options. OnoGrindzManoa will enable users to find places to eat which match their preferences and facilitate a better dining experience for the UH Manoa commmunity. This page will be regularly updated with project information throughout the development process.

Part of the goal to make OnoGrindzManoa easy for users to use is that anyone with a UH account will be able to login by clicking on the login button. The UH CAS authentication screen will then appear and requests the user's UH account and password.
 
Once authenticated, the user will be able to create a profile that provides information about them and a list of favorite/preferred foods and places to eat, plus links to selected social media sites (GitHub, FaceBook, Instagram).
  
After creating a profile, the user will be listed on the public directory page

We also aim to provide a filter page, available to those who can login to the system with their UH account. The filter page will allow you to display all portfolios with a given favorite/preference.

# Development History

The development process for OnoGrindzManoa will conform to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/modules/project-management/) practices. Development will consist of a series of Milestones whch are divided up into issues that correspond to 2-3 day tasks. GitHub projects will be used to manage the processing of tasks for each milestone.  

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on November 6, 2018 and will end on November 15, 2018.

The goal of Milestone 1 is to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system. 

Additional milestones will be added as the project progresses.
