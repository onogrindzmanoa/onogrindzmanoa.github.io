# About OnoGrindzManoa 

OnoGrindzManoa is a Meteor application currently in development with the goal of providing dining information for the University of Hawaii community. Finding food on campus is a significant challenge, especially becuase there are so many options. OnoGrindzManoa will enable users to find places to eat which match their preferences and facilitate a better dining experience for the UH Manoa commmunity. This page will be regularly updated with project information throughout the development process.
 
Once logged in, vendors will be able to create a profile that provides information about them and their menu. Users will be able to search for vendors/menus that match their preferences. Administrators will be able to manage the app and view areas which may be restricted for other users.

We also aim to provide a search function, available to those who can login to the system with their account. The search function will allow users to display all vendors with a given favorite/preference for menu, style of food, quality of service, etc.

## List Vendors
The user can then navigate to the list of vendors which enables them to view each vendor's information and has links to their menus. We are working to implement the ability for users to search the database of vendors to find ones which meet their preferences.
